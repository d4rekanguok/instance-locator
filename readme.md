# Instance Locator

A simple [sketch]() plugin that helps locating instances of a selected symbol.

#### How it works

- Select a symbol or any instance in your document
- Run the plugin
- A dialog with a dropdown list of all instances and their location (artboard or page) will show up
- Select one
- The plugin will navigate to that board

Built upon [abynim](github.com/abynim)'s [abstracted search script](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/sketch-plugin-snippets-for-plugin-developers-e9e1d2ab6827) and inspired by [Sketch-Navigator](https://github.com/arshad/Sketch-Navigator) by [arshad](github.com/arshad)
